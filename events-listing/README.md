# Apps Listing

This prototype was built with **React** and bootstrapped it with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In `src` folder you can see the container and components made to render the app. On the other hand, in `build` folder you can find a production build of the app.

## Run the app!

To quickly and easily try the app you just need to serve it in a static server. Inside `build` folder, run:
```
	npm install -g serve
	serve -s build
```
The last command shown above will serve the app at http://localhost:5000.

## Run in development mode

If you want to try the app in development mode, inside `src` folder you need to run:
```
	npm install
	npm start
```
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.
